Teatro Amalia hosts Redicolo puppet theater throughout two Sunday morning cycles, presenting all four productions from this innovative puppet group known for handcrafted large-scale puppets, distinctive mixed theatrical techniques, and interaction between puppets, actors, and audience that defines their contemporary approach to puppetry. The November 9th performances launch a festive theatrical season celebrating puppet theater as sophisticated art form for all ages rather than simplified children's entertainment.

For families seeking puppet theater that respects children's intelligence while engaging adult sensibilities, Redicolo offers rare combination of artistic integrity and accessibility. The productions demonstrate how puppet theater operates as complete art form integrating visual art, performance, music, and narrative in ways unique to this medium, inviting audiences into imaginative worlds where magic feels earned through craftsmanship and vision.
