Haig Yazdjian Quintet brings the soul of Eastern Mediterranean music to Athens this November 8th at Theatre of the NO. The internationally acclaimed oud virtuoso leads an exceptional ensemble through an evening of world music that bridges traditional Eastern sounds with contemporary global influences, starting at 21:30.

Born in Syria with deep Armenian roots, Haig Yazdjian has emerged as one of world music's most compelling voices. His mastery of the oud—the pear-shaped string instrument central to Middle Eastern musical traditions—has earned him collaborations with top international artists and recognition across continents. His unique approach honors the instrument's ancient heritage while pushing its boundaries into new sonic territories.

For this special Athens performance, Yazdjian assembles a quintet of virtuosos who each bring distinctive traditional Greek and Eastern instruments into conversation. Giorgos Kontogiannis commands the lyra, the bowed string instrument whose plaintive voice echoes through Cretan and Pontic musical traditions. Tasos Poulios navigates the kanun, a trapezoidal zither whose 78 strings create cascading melodic textures fundamental to Ottoman court music. Yannis Kirimkiridis anchors the ensemble on piano and keys, providing harmonic depth that connects Eastern modal systems with Western jazz harmonies. Thanos Chatzianagnostou on drums brings rhythmic complexity, bridging traditional Middle Eastern percussion patterns with contemporary groove sensibilities.

The concert features new unreleased compositions that showcase the quintet's dynamic range—from introspective solo passages to explosive ensemble moments. Expect atmospheric explorations where the oud's resonant tones dialogue with the lyra's expressive slides, while the kanun adds shimmering harmonic layers. The program moves through emotional territories both melancholic and celebratory, reflecting the diverse musical traditions these instruments represent.

Theatre of the NO provides an ideal intimate setting for this acoustic exploration. Located at Konstantinou Palaiologou 3, directly opposite Athens City Hall in the heart of the capital, the venue has established itself as a key space for quality world music presentations. Its atmosphere encourages the focused listening this music deserves, where subtle instrumental interactions and improvisational moments can fully unfold.

Athens continues positioning itself as a vital hub for world music in the Eastern Mediterranean, where artists like Yazdjian find audiences hungry for music that transcends borders while honoring deep cultural roots. This concert represents world music at its finest—musicians in genuine dialogue, creating something neither purely traditional nor entirely contemporary, but authentically alive.
