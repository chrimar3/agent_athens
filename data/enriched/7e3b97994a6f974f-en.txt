Every Sunday at noon in Athens' artistic Metaxourgeio neighborhood, Theatre Metaxourgeio transforms into a magical mountain world where Ririka the bear celebrates the true meaning of friendship. Based on Maria Kilaedoni's beloved children's book, "Τα γενέθλια της Ριρίκας" (Ririka's Birthday) returns for its third triumphant season, offering families with children aged 2-10 an unforgettable 55-minute musical theater experience.

The story follows Ririka, who faces her first birthday alone after relocating to a new mountain. Determined to maintain her traditions, she journeys to the city seeking her favorite pistachio ice cream, only to discover the shop unexpectedly closed. What begins as potential disappointment transforms into a heartwarming adventure as Ririka encounters her diverse group of friends: Pi and Ro, the twin porcupines who craft spectacular fireworks; Dionysis the crocodile, a talented pastry chef; Tito and Lia, lion siblings who bring the production alive with live guitar, piano, and accordion; and Charlie the kangaroo, whose dance moves delight audiences of all ages.

Director Γιασεμί Κηλαηδόνη (Yiasemi Kilaedoni) brings her sister Maria Kilaedoni's original work to vibrant theatrical life, supported by the collaborative genius of theatrical adapter Άντα Γκουρμπαλή (Anta Gourmpali) and costume designer Νεφέλη Καρυοφύλλη (Nefeli Karyofylli), whose creations help young audiences distinguish each character's unique personality. The cast features Μαρία Κηλαηδόνη (Maria Kilaedoni), Αλέξανδρος Λυκούρας (Alexandros Lykouras), and Μάριος Πετρίδης (Marios Petridis), who collectively embody multiple characters with infectious energy and authentic warmth.

Theatre Metaxourgeio sits in one of Athens' most culturally dynamic districts, where industrial heritage meets contemporary artistic innovation. The Metaxourgeio neighborhood has evolved from manufacturing hub to creative sanctuary, making it the perfect setting for this celebration of community and belonging. Families attending Sunday performances discover not only exceptional children's theater but also cafes, galleries, and the genuine neighborhood atmosphere that defines modern Athenian cultural life.

The production's accessibility—tickets range from €10-12—reflects Maria Kilaedoni's commitment to making quality children's theater available to all Athens families. The 12:00pm Sunday scheduling perfectly accommodates young attention spans while allowing families to explore Metaxourgeio before or after the performance. Starting November 9, 2025, this third season promises the same magic that has made Ririka's Birthday a beloved Athens tradition for children discovering theater's transformative power and parents rediscovering the joy of shared storytelling through live music, vibrant performance, and universal themes of friendship and community.
