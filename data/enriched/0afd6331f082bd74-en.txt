Iro Sagia presents "Rebetisses - Voices that Didn't Bend" on November 20th and 23rd at Alsos DEI Theater, offering a musical immersion into the treasure of rebetiko through the women who marked the genre. With her distinctive voice, theatrical presence, and sensitivity, Sagia bridges yesterday with today in a performance tribute to emblematic female figures of rebetiko—voices that sang their truth without bending.

The rebetisses were women who sang "like men," lived "like fire," and left behind songs like knives and stories that became myths. Rosa Eskenazy, Marika Ninou, Rita Abatzi, Sotiria Bellou, Stella Haskil, Sevas Hanoum, Ioanna Georgakopoulou, and Angela Papazoglou—each name represents not just a singer but a force who defied social conventions and gender expectations to claim space in a male-dominated musical world. These were voices from harbors and coasts, taverns and refugee courtyards, carrying laments, boldness, and trembling pride.

The rebetisses weren't merely entertainers. They were activists in their way, giving voice to marginalized communities when no one else listened. Their songs documented the Greek experience through wars, displacement, poverty, and resilience.

The performance represents what cultural preservation should be—not static recreation but living dialogue between past and present, honoring those who came before while speaking to those present now. The rebetisses sang when society told them to be silent, performed when convention demanded invisibility, and claimed authority over their own stories through music. Sagia's tribute acknowledges their courage while demonstrating that their voices, far from bending, continue resonating with power and relevance.
