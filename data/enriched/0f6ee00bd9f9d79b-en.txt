Chamber music ensemble Smari presents "Night Flight" (Νυχτερινή πτήση) at Theatre of the NO on Sunday, November 23 at 20:00, inviting audiences on an immersive journey through the musical landscapes of the Eastern Mediterranean. With tickets priced at 12 euros, this performance offers access to one of Athens' most intriguing experimental ensembles—a sextet that explores how ancient musical traditions from Greece and the Middle East can resonate meaningfully in contemporary contexts. The ensemble's instrumentation deliberately combines continuous-sound instruments (two ney flutes, lyra, cello, double bass) with voice used as a musical instrument, creating flexible sonic possibilities that bridge centuries and cultures.

The instrumentation itself tells the story of Smari's aesthetic philosophy. The ney, an ancient end-blown flute central to both Turkish classical music and Sufi devotional practice, produces haunting sustained tones that have evoked spiritual transcendence for millennia. The lyra, whether referencing the Cretan, Pontic, or Constantinopolitan variants, connects to Greek folk traditions stretching back centuries.

This approach connects to broader conversations within Greek music about tradition, modernity, and authenticity. Greece's complex history—Byzantine heritage, Ottoman occupation, Western European influence, modern nation-state formation—means that "traditional Greek music" itself represents multiple contested traditions. Smari's willingness to acknowledge that complexity, to draw from multiple sources without claiming singular authenticity, positions them within contemporary artistic movements that embrace hybridity over purity.

The ensemble has performed at prestigious Athens venues including the Greek National Opera's Festivals of Sacred Music, the School of Attic Drama, the Megaron Athens Concert Hall, and the Anglican Church of St. Paul. These diverse contexts—opera house, drama school, concert hall, church—indicate Smari's versatility and the various frameworks through which their music can be understood: concert music, theatrical accompaniment, sacred music, world music.

A particularly notable project is their recording of "Katalogi," composed by Martha Mavroidi and based on the Moiróloi of the Virgin Mary. The moirológi (lament) represents one of Greek music's most ancient and emotionally powerful forms—ritualized grief expression through vocalization that predates written history. Mavroidi's composition honors this tradition while creating something distinctly contemporary, accompanied by video footage from the documentary "In Her Body" to create a multimedia artwork.

For Athens residents interested in music that transcends easy categorization, Smari offers rare experiences. Their work appeals to listeners from diverse backgrounds: world music enthusiasts tracking cross-cultural fusion; classical music fans interested in contemporary chamber music; Greek music devotees curious about traditional forms reimagined; and thoughtful listeners simply seeking beautiful, meaningful music regardless of genre classification.
