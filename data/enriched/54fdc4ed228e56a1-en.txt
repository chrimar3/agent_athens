Dido Sotiriou's "Entoli" (Command) returns to Theatre Nous for its second season, a testament to its resonance during last winter's run when it sparked conversations about history, politics, and moral courage. Director Nadia Dalkiriadou's adaptation of Sotiriou's landmark work examines one of modern Greek history's most painful episodes: the arrest, trial, and execution of Nikos Beloyannis on espionage charges during Greece's post-Civil War period.

The production's power emerges from its refusal to sentimentalize. Beloyannis becomes neither martyred saint nor hollow propaganda. Instead, he appears as a human who faced impossible choices with unwavering conviction.

The production team includes Maria Apatsidou (assistant director), Eleni Panagiotopoulos (second assistant director), Georgia Bourda (sets and costumes), Giorgos Psychramis (lighting), Marina Mavroyeni (movement and choreography with assistant Marianna Solom onidis), Odysseas Gkallios (musical supervision and composition), and Stephanos Michailidis (poster design). This collaborative effort, produced by KARAK AMKE, demonstrates Greek theater's capacity to transform historical material into urgent contemporary questioning.

Theatre Nous at Troias 34 hosts Saturday performances at 21:15 and Sunday at 20:15. Tickets range from €10 (group bookings over 10) to €15 regular admission, with reduced rates for students, unemployed, and seniors.
