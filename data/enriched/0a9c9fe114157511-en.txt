Apostolos Kitsos returns to Stavros tou Notou Plus on Thursday, November 20th, bringing his distinctive blend of contemporary laika with a special guest appearance by Eleni Tsaligopoulou. This isn't nostalgia act or traditional rebetiko revival—Kitsos represents a new generation approaching Greek popular music with fresh arrangements and emotional honesty while respecting the genre's roots.

With two albums already released—"Kati Paraxeno" (Something Strange) and "Anahoresei" (Departure)—and a third in production with Stavros Tsante featuring "aliotica" (alternative) laika songs, Kitsos has established himself as an artist willing to push boundaries within the laika tradition. His approach maintains the emotional directness and melodic richness of Greek popular music while incorporating contemporary production and arrangements that feel relevant to younger audiences without alienating traditionalists.

The ticket structure offers accessibility while rewarding early commitment. Early bird tickets at €12 for limited quantity provide affordable entry, with general admission at €14. Advance purchase through more.com is strongly recommended given Stavros tou Notou Plus's capacity and Kitsos's growing following.

For anyone interested in contemporary Greek music that honors tradition without being imprisoned by it, or simply wanting to experience Athens's living musical culture beyond tourist-oriented performances, this concert offers authentic engagement with Greek popular song in active evolution. The combination of Kitsos's vision, the band's skill, and Tsaligopoulou's guest appearance promises an evening that respects the past while firmly inhabiting the present.
