Playfield offers families with children aged 0-6 years an outdoor educational program in the surroundings of the Peace and Friendship Stadium, where nature's simple materials become tools for imaginative play and creative exploration. This program challenges contemporary childhood's over-structured activities by returning to elemental experiences: sticks, stones, leaves, and earth transformed through imagination into whatever young minds envision, guided by professional pedagogues who facilitate rather than direct.

For families seeking alternatives to commercialized children's entertainment or hyper-structured enrichment activities, Playfield offers refreshing simplicity. The program trusts children's inherent creativity, providing supportive context without imposing predetermined outcomes. The focus on process rather than product teaches valuable lessons about enjoying activities for their own sake rather than external validation. In an educational landscape often emphasizing measurable outcomes and skill acquisition, Playfield celebrates play's intrinsic value as essential childhood work.
