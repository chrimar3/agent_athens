"η μικρή λέξη αγάπη" (The Small Word Love) returns to Athens for three final performances before embarking on its third nationwide tour, following two sold-out seasons that captivated audiences across Greece. Based on Avgoustos Korto's acclaimed novel published by Patakis, this powerful theatrical adaptation confronts the urgent issue of gender-based and domestic violence through the harrowing story of Mantia, a young woman trapped in cycles of abuse.

Adapted and directed by Nantia Dalkyriadou, the production transforms Korto's prose into visceral theater performed by Angeliki Xenou and Vasiliki Kouli, whose dual performance captures both the vulnerability and resilience of a woman seeking escape from violence. The staging at Apo Koinou Theatre—Athens' renowned venue for socially conscious productions—creates an intimate space for this difficult but essential narrative.

Mantia's journey begins in Tyflo Nero, where she learned violence firsthand from her father's hand. Her escape from this first tormentor leads not to freedom but to a new cycle of abuse, cunningly disguised as love. The production asks devastating questions: What does it cost to be a woman? What is the price of life itself? Between life and death, a young woman walks a tightrope, telling her story about this "small word"—love.

The creative team brings exceptional artistry to this challenging material. Odysseas Gallios composed the musical landscape that underscores the emotional intensity, while Elli Empedokli designed the set and costumes that frame Mantia's claustrophobic world. Marina Mavroyeni choreographed the movement vocabulary that speaks when words fail, and Maria Apatsidou served as assistant director. The striking photography by Kostas and Sofia Ravtopoulos captures the production's emotional depth.

After triumphant runs in Athens, Komotini, Patras, Thessaloniki, Larissa, and Ioannina, these three November performances (Sundays at 8:00 PM) mark the production's Athens farewell before its third season tour begins. The overwhelming audience response—consistent sold-out houses—reflects not just the production's artistic merit but society's recognition that this story demands telling and hearing.

Apo Koinou Theatre's commitment to productions addressing social issues makes it the ideal home for Korto's narrative. At just €8, the production remains accessible to all audiences, particularly important given its mission to spark conversations about domestic violence. This is theater as social intervention, where art confronts uncomfortable truths while honoring survivors' experiences.

For mature audiences ready to engage with challenging content, "η μικρή λέξη αγάπη" offers more than entertainment—it provides essential testimony about violence hidden behind love's facade, performed with artistic integrity and profound humanity.
