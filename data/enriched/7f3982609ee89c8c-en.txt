On November 11th, 2025, BIOS transforms into a space where memory and forgetting collide through movement, text, and physical intensity. "›—˜—" (Lethe)named for the river of oblivion in Greek mythologypresents a dance-theater experience that refuses easy categorization or comfortable consumption. This isn't entertainment designed to please. It's a descent into questions about what we remember, what we suppress, and what costs we bear for both.

The production draws inspiration from Dimitris Dimitriadis's work "›—˜—," transforming literary source material into choreographic experience. Director and choreographer Eva Stavrogianni collaborates with performers Niki Sereti, Lena Bozaki, and Magdalini Spinou to create what the production describes as "a physical and psychological descent"theater that demands audiences engage through bodies and minds simultaneously, that refuses separation between intellectual contemplation and visceral response.

The production's conceptual framework centers on a deserted place that becomes "a field of memory and silence." Each footprint carves imprint; each imprint generates form. Bodies fight and mourn, doubt and declare, tear apart and fall silent. Every movement creates fracture; every breath carries weight. The suggestion that forgetting equals amnesia becomes central provocationquestioning whether what we choose not to remember truly disappears or simply waits, buried but not gone, ready to resurface when defenses weaken.

Stavrogianni's creative team brings impressive credentials to this challenging material. Dramaturgical editing by Elena Triantafyllopoulou ensures textual elements serve theatrical experience rather than overwhelming it. Sound design by Antonis Papakonstantinou creates sonic landscapes that amplify rather than illustrate movement. Lighting by Melina Mascha transforms BIOS's industrial space into environments where darkness and illumination carry equal emotional weight. Costume design by Maria Zervaki, special constructions by 4M STUDIOS, and makeup by Sissy Petropoula complete the visual vocabulary.

BIOS, located in Athens' evolving cultural landscape, provides ideal infrastructure for experimental performance work that pushes beyond conventional theater's comfortable boundaries. The venue's commitment to challenging programming creates environment where artists can take genuine risks, where failure in service of artistic ambition carries more value than safe success, where audiences arrive expecting to be challenged rather than merely entertained.

The production's timingNovember 11thpositions "›—˜—" during Athens' autumn cultural season, when audiences seek substance over spectacle, when the year's accumulated experiences create receptivity to work that addresses difficult questions rather than providing easy escapes. For Athens theatergoers interested in performance that treats bodies as philosophical instruments, that understands movement as a form of thinking, and that refuses to separate artistic ambition from emotional honesty, "›—˜—" represents essential programming. This is theater that asks what you would sacrifice to break the stone of memory that holds you captiveand then creates conditions where that question becomes more than rhetorical. Productions like this validate BIOS's role as Athens' home for work that values artistic integrity over commercial safety.
