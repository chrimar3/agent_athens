Aka Architecture Kids Athens presents its Sunday Architecture Workshop series, offering children aged 5-12 hands-on introductions to architectural thinking, spatial design, and creative construction. This standalone workshop program runs throughout the academic year, providing families flexibility to participate in individual 90-minute sessions priced at 20 euros each, with maximum 16 children per workshop ensuring personalized attention.

The program divides participants into two age groups experiencing age-appropriate architectural challenges. Children aged 5-8 (kindergarten through second grade) attend morning sessions from 10:30-12:00, while older children aged 8-12 (third through sixth grade) participate in afternoon sessions from 12:30-14:00. This thoughtful scheduling recognizes different developmental stages, attention spans, and skill levels, allowing instructors to tailor activities that neither overwhelm younger children nor bore advanced students.

Each workshop explores distinct architectural themes through making: constructing models, drawing plans, creating collages, and experimenting with materials. Children engage directly with the design process, understanding how architects translate ideas into three-dimensional reality. Activities might involve designing imaginary buildings, exploring structural principles through hands-on construction, investigating how light and space interact, or reimagining familiar urban spaces. The emphasis remains consistently on creative problem-solving rather than rote learning.

The workshops run on selected Sundays from September 2025 through June 2026, with 18 sessions scheduled across the academic year. This extended calendar accommodates families' varying schedules, school holidays, and other commitments. Parents can select specific dates that align with their availability rather than feeling obligated to attend every session. The program particularly appeals to children who demonstrate passion for building, drawing, and spatial thinking but whose families cannot commit to weekly attendance or full-semester programs.

Aka Architecture Kids Athens brings professional architectural education into an accessible, playful format designed specifically for young learners. The organization recognizes that architectural thinking—understanding how spaces function, how structures stand, how design affects experience—represents valuable literacy applicable far beyond architecture itself. Children who learn to observe their built environment critically develop skills valuable across numerous disciplines.

The workshop venue provides dedicated creative space equipped with appropriate materials, tools, and resources for architectural exploration. Instructors combine professional architectural knowledge with pedagogical expertise, creating atmospheres where experimentation is encouraged and mistakes become learning opportunities. The intimate class size ensures each child receives individual guidance while benefiting from collaborative group dynamics.

For Athens families seeking enriching weekend activities combining creativity, critical thinking, and hands-on making, these workshops offer exceptional value. Tickets available through Viva.gr for specific dates throughout the nine-month program. Contact: info@architecturekidsathens.com or 210 6544724.
