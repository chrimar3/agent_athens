Oi Dimokratores (The Democrats) opens at Theatro tou Neou Kosmou with a grotesque farce exploring authoritarian fantasies and contemporary political paranoia. Written and directed by Giannis Aposkitis, this dark comedy forms the second part of an informal political trilogy, following his 2022 production Provokátores at the Experimental Stage of the National Theatre. Aposkitis continues examining modern political and social reality through theatrical absurdism that makes the unthinkable disturbingly recognizable.

The play's premise is deceptively simple: doctoral psychiatric student John Doe visits Newman Clinic intending to perform lobotomy surgery for the first time in history—a revolutionary but barbaric procedure. Upon arrival, instead of surgical intervention, a "therapeutic" experiment unfolds that dramatizes the authoritarian fantasies of a schizophrenic patient who calls himself "The Democrat of Orygia." John is forced to participate in this experiment, confronting the thin line between medical treatment and political control, sanity and madness, healing and violence.

The play's dark comedy emerges from recognizing familiar political behaviors in extreme theatrical form. When a psychiatric patient declares himself "Democrat" while enforcing absolute control, the irony cuts directly to how authoritarian leaders co-opt democratic language. The lobotomy premise, a procedure that destroys personality in the name of curing illness, becomes metaphor for how authoritarian systems claim to heal society while actually destroying individual autonomy and critical thought.

Music by Dimitris Lolis, performed live on stage by the composer himself, provides emotional texture and transitions. Live music on stage creates immediate presence and responsiveness impossible with recorded sound, allowing the score to breathe with the performance. Scenography by Konstantinos Skourletis creates the clinical environment essential to the play's premise while allowing theatrical transformation.

The production's visual identity for Theatro tou Neou Kosmou's 2025-26 season comes from creative director and art director Paris Mexis, with art direction and graphic design by Thomas Palyvos—establishing consistent aesthetic framework for the season's programming. This attention to visual identity reflects how the venue positions itself within Athens's theatrical landscape: professionally ambitious while maintaining accessibility.

For audiences interested in political theater that trusts intelligence rather than lecturing, or dark comedy that mines contemporary anxieties for insight rather than cheap laughs, Oi Dimokratores offers sharp observation dressed in entertaining form. The play doesn't provide answers—it asks uncomfortable questions about how societies accept authoritarian control, how medical and political authority intertwine, and how we perform democracy while practicing its opposite. Ticket prices start at €17 for general admission.
