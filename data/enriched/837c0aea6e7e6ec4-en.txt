Around the World with 5 Fairy Tales brings extraordinary puppet theater to Theatre 104 in Athens' vibrant Gkazi neighborhood. Created by the Paramythohora puppet theater company, this innovative production features forty handcrafted puppets, shadow theater, animation, and live narration, offering families with children aged three and up an immersive journey across five continents through beloved folk tales from around the world.

The performance centers on young Thanos discovering a mysterious package from his grandfather Aristeidis filled with treasures and mementos from distant lands. Each object unlocks a captivating story, transforming an ordinary children's bedroom into a magical gateway for exploring European, Asian, African, American, and Australian folklore traditions. The production showcases human-sized handmade puppets, marotte puppets, direct manipulation techniques, shadow theater, black theater methods, and original musical compositions by Dimitris Oikonomakis that capture the distinctive sonic textures and cultural essence of each civilization represented on stage.

Spyridoula and Maria Papageorgiou deliver engaging performances while also serving as the production's puppet designers, costume creators, set designers, and directors. Their collaborative artistic vision brings five remarkable tales to life: a Polish legend about a clever dragon-slayer who challenges powerful royal knights, the West African story of Anansi the spider-man attempting to hoard all worldly wisdom inside a giant gourd, an American tall tale celebrating the gentle giant lumberjack and his loyal blue ox companion, a Chinese narrative about a magical paintbrush that brings drawings to life, and an Aboriginal Australian creation myth explaining drought through the memorable story of Tindalik the thirsty frog.

Dimitra Kritikidi choreographed the production's dynamic movement sequences, while Melina Mascha designed atmospheric lighting that enhances the theatrical magic throughout each scene. Photography by Giorgos Vettos documents this ambitious theatrical undertaking. The production addresses universal themes including diversity, inclusion, friendship, courage, environmental awareness, and social justice through naturally woven narratives that avoid heavy-handed didacticism while thoroughly entertaining young audiences with humor and imagination.

Theatre 104 on Evmolpidon Street provides an intimate venue setting perfect for this scale of puppet theater artistry, allowing families to closely experience the intricate craftsmanship and artistic detail of each handmade creation. The Gkazi neighborhood, widely known for its cultural venues and easily accessible location near central Athens, makes this production conveniently reachable for families throughout the metropolitan area.

Performances run Sundays at twelve-thirty, with additional weekday shows available for organized school groups. Tickets are priced at eleven euros for both adults and children, making this an accessible and affordable cultural experience for Athens families seeking quality children's entertainment.
