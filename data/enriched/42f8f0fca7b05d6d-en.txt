Every Saturday night at Caja de Música, Vasilis Lekkas takes the stage to honor one of Greek music's most beloved voices in "In Tolis' Constellation," a tribute to the legendary Tolis Voskopoulos. Starting November 8, 2025, this weekly residency at the intimate venue on Sinopis 27 transforms into a celebration of Greece's romantic laiko tradition, where generations of music lovers gather to relive the golden era of Greek popular song.

Tolis Voskopoulos defined an epoch in Greek music with his unmistakable voice, magnetic stage presence, and emotional depth that resonated across decades. His songs became the soundtrack to countless lives, capturing romance, heartbreak, and the essence of Greek sentiment. Vasilis Lekkas, himself a distinguished interpreter of Greek song, approaches this tribute with reverence and personal connection, breathing new life into melodies that shaped the nation's musical identity.

Joining Lekkas on stage is Ioanna Emmanouel, adding her distinctive voice to this homage. Together, they navigate through Voskopoulos's extensive repertoire, selecting songs that showcase his range from passionate ballads to uplifting anthems. The evening becomes more than performance—it evolves into a shared memory between artists and audience, where familiar refrains spark collective nostalgia.

The musical foundation rests with seven exceptional musicians who bring orchestral richness to every Saturday night. Giorgos Konstantinidis provides orchestration and piano, establishing the harmonic landscape. Stathis Savvidis and Dimitris Koufogiorgos deliver the essential bouzouki sound that defines Greek laiko, their strings weaving traditional textures throughout. Sofia Mavrogenidou's flute adds lyrical counterpoint, while Christos Evangelatos's guitar, Leonidas Filintas's bass, and Andreas Nikolis's drums create the contemporary rhythmic backbone that keeps these classic songs vibrant for modern audiences.

Caja de Música, located in the heart of Athens at Sinopis and Michalakopoulos, provides the perfect setting for this intimate musical journey. The venue's warm atmosphere and excellent acoustics allow every nuance of Lekkas's interpretation to reach the audience, maintaining the tradition of quality Greek music venues where artists and patrons share close proximity.

At 22:00 every Saturday, with tickets priced at 15 euros, "In Tolis' Constellation" offers accessible entry into Greece's musical heritage. This isn't merely a cover show—it's a continuation of tradition, where Vasilis Lekkas positions himself within Voskopoulos's constellation, honoring the past while keeping these timeless songs alive for present and future generations. The weekly format allows the repertoire to evolve, ensuring regular attendees discover new interpretations alongside cherished favorites throughout the season.
