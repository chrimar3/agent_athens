The Athens Children's Museum collaborates with Bonding Nest to present Imagination and Curiosity, an educational workshop exploring how young brains develop through play, wonder, and secure emotional connections. Designed for families with children aged 4-6 years, this program combines neuroscience insights with hands-on activities that demonstrate how childhood learning happens most effectively when children feel safe, joyful, and connected to caregivers.

Pricing reflects the workshop's educational mission while acknowledging the museum's operational costs. The investment provides families with knowledge and strategies extending far beyond the single session. For Athens families seeking evidence-based approaches to early childhood development, this workshop offers rare access to expert guidance in an engaging, child-friendly format that respects both scientific research and the messy reality of actual family life.
