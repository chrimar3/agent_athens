Odyssevah returns to Kolossaion Theatre, bringing generations of Athens families together for one of modern Greek children's theater's most beloved productions. Written by Xenia Kalogeropoula with music by legendary composer Dionysis Savvopoulos, this landmark work has shaped Greek theatrical culture since its debut, blending Homer's Odyssey with Arabian Nights into a timeless journey of imagination.

Directed by Dimitra Larentzaki, the production unfolds at Kolossaion Theatre, a historic cinema-theater in Athens that provides the perfect intimate setting for this multi-generational experience. The story follows Odyssevah, a child born between East and West, embarking on adventures where fantasy becomes the vessel and fairy tales serve as compass. Through vibrant storytelling, live music, and dynamic stage action, the production creates a complete theatrical event that speaks to both children discovering wonder and adults reconnecting with childhood dreams.

Savvopoulos's musical contribution elevates this beyond typical children's theater. As one of Greece's most influential musicians, his compositions infuse the production with cultural depth that resonates across generations. His melodies transform ancient mythology into living songs that children carry home, making Odyssevah as much a musical experience as theatrical one.

The creative team brings exceptional artistry to every element. Katerina Papageorgiou's scenic design creates worlds that shift between Mediterranean shores and oriental palaces. Maria Kavaliotis's costumes blend mythological references with fairy tale aesthetics, while Paschalia Akritidou's choreography moves the narrative through physical poetry. Olympia Sideridou's masks add theatrical magic, transforming performers into legendary characters.

Seven talented actors bring this journey to life: Lydia Anestopoulou, Vangelis Kallitsoglou, Myrto Mitsopoulou, Thanos Poumakis, Kornilia Prokopiou, Thanasis Tzintzios, and Christina Chalkia. Together they embody multiple characters, switching seamlessly between roles as the story demands, creating an ensemble energy that keeps young audiences captivated.

Assistant director Kelly Giakoumaki supports Larentzaki's vision, while production director Bilio Konstantopoulou ensures smooth operations. Kolossaion Productions constructs the scenery, and Moutzoura provides striking poster artwork that captures the production's blend of Eastern and Western aesthetics.

Performances run every Sunday at 11:30 AM, with weekday showings available for school groups. At twelve euros, Odyssevah offers accessible family entertainment that delivers genuine artistic value. The production reminds audiences that imagination, hope, and love remain our strongest tools for life's journey. Parents and children sail together through seas of storytelling, discovering that no ocean proves stronger than a dreaming heart. This isn't merely children's theater—it's cultural heritage in motion, preserving Greece's theatrical traditions while inspiring new generations to embrace adventure, curiosity, and the transformative power of stories that bridge cultures and centuries.
