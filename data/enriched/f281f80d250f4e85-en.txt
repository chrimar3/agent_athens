The Foundation for Pastoral Education of the Holy Archdiocese of Athens presents an interactive virtual reality journey through the Holy Monastery of Osios Loukas in Boeotia, offered with free admission at the Tholos theater in Ellinikos Kosmos cultural center. This production realizes the vision of Archbishop Ieronymos II, digitizing sacred treasures from parish churches while making them accessible to contemporary audiences through cutting-edge visualization technology.

The Tholos theater at Ellinikos Kosmos provides an immersive viewing environment where the virtual reality technology reveals its full potential. Free admission reflects the project's mission of making sacred cultural heritage accessible to all audiences, regardless of economic means. For those unable to travel to Boeotia, this experience offers intimate encounter with one of Greece's most significant religious and architectural monuments, preserved through digital innovation for future generations.
