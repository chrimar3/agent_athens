The Maria Callas Museum presents The Textures of Theater, an innovative infant theater program introducing babies aged 0-2 years to performance art through touch, sound, and movement. This sensory journey creates a warm, safe, specially designed space where infants discover the world of opera and stage through materials of different textures including velvet, tulle, and silk, while experimenting with music, theatrical objects, and small stories inspired by Maria Callas's voice.

The program duration and session structure account for infant attention spans and daily rhythms. Activities flow gently rather than following rigid schedules, allowing natural breaks when babies need feeding, changing, or rest. This flexibility distinguishes thoughtful infant programming from adult-centric events that simply allow baby attendance without genuine adaptation to infant needs. For Athens families seeking developmentally appropriate cultural experiences for their youngest members, The Textures of Theater offers rare opportunities to begin arts education from life's earliest moments.
