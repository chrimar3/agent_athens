On November 10, 2025, the Municipal Theater of Piraeus becomes the epicenter of Greece's most significant conversation about women's sports. GWomen, the 4th Women's Sports Summit organized by Gazzetta and Gazzetta Women, returns with its rallying cry: "TOGETHER. STRONGER. UNSTOPPABLE." This is not merely another sports conference—it's Greece's only event exclusively dedicated to elevating women's athletics while addressing the profound social and psychological barriers female athletes face on their journey to success.

What distinguishes GWomen from conventional sports gatherings is its commitment to excavating the untold stories that rarely surface in mainstream sports media. Under the visionary leadership of concept creators from the Liquid Media - gWOMEN Team, the summit transcends athletic performance to illuminate critical issues: mental resilience in competitive environments, the ongoing struggle for equality and visibility, and the transformative power of authenticity. These aren't abstract concepts—they're lived experiences shared through personal testimonies, rigorous research, and experiential discussions designed to catalyze meaningful change.

The conference's intellectual architecture reflects its ambitious scope. Agenda Directors Βάσω Στασινού Νικοπολίδη (PR Director), Μυρτώ Μήτσιου (Editorial Director), and Πηνελόπη Γκιώνη (Journalist) have curated programming that balances scholarly insight with emotional resonance. Distinguished moderators including Πηνελόπη Γκιώνη, Μυρτώ Μήτσιου, Χριστίνα Κατσαμούρη, Μάρθα Χωριανοπούλου, and Δημήτρης Μύτικας guide conversations that challenge participants to reimagine what's possible for women in Greek athletics.

The historic Municipal Theater of Piraeus—a cultural landmark in Greece's largest port city, just moments from Athens—provides an appropriately grand setting for this watershed event. Produced by Liquid Media - Gazzetta.gr under CEO Παναγιώτης Γεωργόπουλος, with production and promotion led by Marketing Director Χριστίνα Ρόκα and Marketing Executive Εύη Κλειτσίκα, GWomen represents institutional commitment to systemic change.

Accessibility remains paramount: tickets are priced at €15, with free admission for unemployed individuals and people with disabilities—a deliberate choice that underscores the conference's inclusive mission. This is more than a summit; it's a movement. For athletes, coaches, sports administrators, journalists, and advocates seeking to understand and dismantle the obstacles facing female athletes in Greece, GWomen offers an irreplaceable space for connection, education, and collective action. The event starts at the Municipal Theater of Piraeus on November 10, 2025—where Greece's women's sports community gathers to be together, stronger, and truly unstoppable.
