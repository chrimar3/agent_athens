In the heart of Metaxourgeio, Από Μηχανής Θέατρο - Κάτω Σκηνή (Lower Stage) prepares to welcome young audiences for the third consecutive year with "ΕΓΩ ΤΟ ΞΩΤΙΚΟ" (I Am the Elf), a enchanting Christmas production that has captured the hearts of Athens families since its premiere. Based on the beloved children's book by Μαριβίτα Γραμματικάκη, published by KALENDIS Editions, this 70-minute musical adventure has earned sold-out status throughout the 2024-2025 season—a testament to its universal appeal among nursery, kindergarten, and early elementary school children.

Director Δημήτρης Μυλωνάς brings this delicate story to life with sensitivity and imagination, creating a production that resonates equally with children discovering these themes for the first time and parents rediscovering them through their children's eyes. The musical landscape, composed and directed by Μαρίνα Χρονοπούλου, transforms the Christmas forest into a sonic wonderland that enhances every emotional beat of the story. Γιώργος Λιντζέρις's set and costume design transports audiences directly into the elves' workshop, while Ειρήνη Κυρμιζάκη's choreography and Βλάσσης Θεοδωρίδης's lighting design add layers of magic to every scene.

Από Μηχανής Θέατρο, located at Akadimou 13 in the culturally vibrant Metaxourgeio neighborhood, has established itself as a cornerstone of Athens children's theater. At just €10 per ticket (€8 for groups of 20 or more), the production offers exceptional value for families seeking meaningful cultural experiences during the holiday season. Every Sunday at 3:00 PM through the season, the Lower Stage fills with laughter, wonder, and the timeless message that true Christmas magic lies not in glory or recognition, but in the love we share and the joy we give to others.
