NEVERMIND brings the raw intensity of couples therapy to Theatre Nous-Creative space in Athens, offering audiences an unflinching look at relationships in crisis. British playwright Roger Ennals crafts a psychological drama that transforms the therapy room into a stage for confrontation, confession, and unexpected tenderness. This contemporary theater production, translated and directed by Jessica Kourtesi, explores the delicate boundary between love and decay, affection and silence, as a couple attempts to articulate everything that remained unspoken, undone, and unsaved in their relationship.

The play unfolds through a series of therapy sessions where treatment becomes performance, and the struggle for connection takes center stage. Ennals' absurdist lens examines human existence in all its complexity, positioning his characters at the intersection of fear, pain, and turmoil as they search for meaning and their place in an often-incomprehensible world. The couple navigates the fine line between salvaging their shared past and pursuing individual paths of self-discovery, making each session a microcosm of modern relationship dynamics.

Theatre Nous-Creative space, known for experimental and contemporary productions in Athens, provides the perfect intimate setting for this psychological exploration. The venue's commitment to boundary-pushing theater aligns seamlessly with NEVERMIND's unflinching examination of romantic partnership and personal identity.

The production features compelling performances by Fani Xenoudaki, Yiannis Sintos, and Jessica Kourtesi, who bring nuance and authenticity to Ennals' complex characters. Their portrayals capture the vulnerability and courage required to confront relationship failures and the possibility of transformation. The creative team elevates the material through carefully crafted design elements: Pierros Papadakos' original music underscores the emotional landscape, while Zoi Vardaki's costume design and Io Spiliotopoulou's lighting create the claustrophobic yet revealing atmosphere of the therapy room. Assistant Director Antzy Filinta contributes to the cohesive vision that makes this production resonate.
