Serra - The Soul of Pontus enters its fourth year of sold-out performances across Greece and Europe, bringing Giannis Kalpouzos's powerful novel to life through Chrysa Papa's extraordinary one-woman performance. After captivating audiences in Athens, Thessaloniki, and cities across Germany and Stockholm, this theatrical experience continues to transcend regional interest, offering a universal story about displacement, identity, and resilience.

Papa performs twelve distinct roles, telling the story of Galinós Philonidis through his daughter Lemonia's voice. The narrative spans 1915 to 1962, following the catastrophic displacement of Greek and Armenian populations from Pontus, Abkhazia, and Kazakhstan during and after World War I. Through Galinós's personal journey—torn between two women and moral principles while facing expulsions and persecutions—the production gives human scale to historical tragedy.

Directed by Sotiris Chatzakis, the production uses theatrical minimalism to maximum effect. Papa transforms empty coats and chairs into living presences, embodying all twelve characters with such intensity that critics describe her "removing the souls of spectators from their bodies and mixing them in a cyclical dance in the air." The show's structure revolves around the Sera dance, a Pontic circle dance performed around fire, functioning both literally and metaphorically as embodiment of cultural continuity despite displacement.

Athinarama praised Papa's performance: "Precise and master of language, deeply authentic, passing with subtle shades from narration to embodiment, stripped down in the Sera dance she performs, she elevates memory as the precious 'amulet' for the next generations." IntroNews called it "a rare case where performance surpasses cinema and technical means, where an actress makes light from darkness and darkness from light."

When refugees dance Sera in foreign lands, they recreate home through rhythm and movement, asserting identity that political violence couldn't erase. Papa's performance of this traditional Pontic circle dance demonstrates how bodily memory preserves what documentary records cannot, making the abstract concept of cultural continuity tangible and emotionally resonant.

The creative team includes theatrical adaptation by Kalpouzos, music composition by Matthaios Tsachouridis rooted in Pontic musical tradition, lighting by Antonis Panagiotópoulos, scenery and costumes by Ersi Drini, and choreography by Stefanos Sidirópoulos. Production by Sifa Production.

Tickets at €15 offer entry into a production that combines artistic excellence with historical importance, making stories of displacement and cultural survival accessible to audiences regardless of personal connection to Pontic history. The specificity of Pontic dialect, traditional music, and regional costume grounds the production in authenticity while universal themes resonate across all backgrounds.
