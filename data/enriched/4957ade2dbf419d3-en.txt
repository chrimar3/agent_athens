When two legendary Marikas meet on stage at Embassy Theater, Athens audiences witness a powerful theatrical encounter that transcends time. "Marika Me Ipane - Marika Me Vgalane" (They Called Me Marika - They Made Me Marika) brings together the spirits of Marika Papagika and Marika Ninou, two titans of Greek rebetiko and traditional music who never met in real life but whose parallel lives illuminate the struggles and triumphs of female artists in early 20th-century Greece.

This State Theatre of Northern Greece (ΚΘΒΕ) co-production arrives in Athens following its hugely successful winter run at Moni Lazariston in Thessaloniki. Under the direction of Asterios Peltekis, ΚΘΒΕ's Artistic Director, the production transforms Embassy Theater every Monday and Tuesday at 20:00 starting November 10, 2025, into historic nightclubs where these musical saints once performed.

Playwright Odysseas Ioannou crafts an intimate dialogue between two women who stood up—literally and figuratively—for their art. Marika Ninou famously broke convention by standing upright while singing, rejecting the seated position expected of female performers. Through narratives interwoven with beloved Smyrneika, rebetiko, and laïka songs, the production explores women's battle for dignity, self-determination, and artistic freedom during decades when Greek society restricted female expression.

Performers Yiota Negka and Korina Legaki embody these complex musical pioneers, supported by narrator Nikoleta Karra who guides audiences through their intertwined stories. Giorgos Andreou's original music and orchestration breathe new life into traditional repertoire while honoring its roots, with lyrics co-written by Andreou and Ioannou that bridge historical and contemporary perspectives.

The production's authenticity shines through its six live musicians performing on stage: Traianos Albanoudis on double bass, Vangelis Kalamaras on drums, Pavlos Pafranidis on bouzouki, Stergios Gargalas on violin, Spyros Chatzikonstantinou on guitars, and Andreou himself on piano. This ensemble recreates the sonic world of early Greek popular music with instruments that defined rebetiko's golden era.

Nikos Charlaftis's costume design and Vasilis Kountouris's video art complete the immersive experience, transporting audiences to smoke-filled venues from Athens to New York where Greek emigrants kept their musical traditions alive. Tickets range from €16-35 depending on seating zone—an accessible price point for experiencing this limited Athens run of a critically acclaimed production.

For lovers of Greek traditional music, rebetiko history, and theater that celebrates female resilience, "Marika Me Ipane - Marika Me Vgalane" offers a rare opportunity to witness two legendary voices speaking across generations at one of Athens's most respected venues.
