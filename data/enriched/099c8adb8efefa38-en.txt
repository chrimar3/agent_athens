Spyros Manesis returns to Athens with his newly formed trio, bringing together three of the most accomplished voices in Greek jazz for an evening that bridges the intimate and the experimental. On November 13th at Half Note Jazz Club in Mets, Manesis presents the Spyros Manesis Trio—a carefully crafted ensemble featuring Periklis Trivolis on double bass and longtime collaborator Anastasis Gouliaris on drums. This is the trio's Athens debut, offering the first listen to material that will soon enter the studio for their next recording.

Half Note Jazz Club in Mets, located at Trivonianos 17 near the Panathenaic Stadium, offers one of Athens's most welcoming environments for acoustic jazz. The intimate space allows for close interaction between musicians and audience, creating an atmosphere where subtle dynamics and delicate interplay can be fully appreciated. For this performance, tables seat four and ticket prices start at €12.

This concert represents both a debut and a retrospective—the first presentation of the new trio format and a comprehensive look at Manesis's distinctive musical temperament. For anyone interested in contemporary European jazz with Greek roots, or in witnessing a working trio refine new material in real time, this evening offers rare access to an artist at the height of his creative powers. The performance begins at 21:30, and given the venue's intimate capacity, advance tickets are strongly recommended.
