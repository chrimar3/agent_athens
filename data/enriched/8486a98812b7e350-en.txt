Almwaya, the musical project of Maya Aghniadis and Wael Sami Elkholy, brings their Mediterranean-influenced experimental soundscapes to Kentro Elegchou Tileoraseon in Athens's Kypseli neighborhood. After two years of anticipation, these two composers with distinct yet complementary musical identities finally perform in the city where their debut album "Riding a Camel in the Middle of the Sea" was born during a fifteen-day artistic residency. Their music weaves together organic and electronic elements, oud and synthesizer, Arabic musical traditions and contemporary experimental approaches into compositions that transcend easy categorization.

The duo's first meeting in Switzerland in 2020 led to the composition of their initial piece, "Bea." This collaboration revealed how their different musical backgrounds could create something neither could achieve alone—the classic promise of creative partnership realized through actual practice. Their subsequent fifteen-day residency in Athens provided the creative space and Mediterranean context that shaped "Riding a Camel in the Middle of the Sea," an eight-composition album that synthesizes their two musical worlds while remaining grounded in Mediterranean influences.

The concert promises an evening of music that rewards active listening, where subtle textural shifts and evolving sonic patterns create immersive experiences. Almwaya's work demands attention rather than serving as background—each composition unfolds gradually, revealing layers of meaning through repeated listening. For those interested in how traditional instruments can speak in contemporary voices, how electronic and acoustic sounds can merge organically, and how different cultural musical traditions can create genuine dialogue rather than superficial fusion, this performance offers valuable examples of what cross-cultural experimental music can achieve when approached with rigor, respect, and genuine collaborative spirit.
