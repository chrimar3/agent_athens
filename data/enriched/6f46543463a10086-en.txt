"The Chained Elephant and the Terrible Enemy" brings two beloved Jorge Bucay stories to life at Cine Astoria in Heraklion, Crete, following its sold-out run in Athens. This enchanting children's theater production, adapted and directed by Dimitris Plionis, transforms the Argentine psychiatrist and storyteller's philosophical tales into an interactive theatrical experience designed for children aged 3 to 12 and their families.

The performance weaves together two powerful narratives exploring universal childhood themes. The first story unfolds in a vibrant circus setting, where jugglers, clowns, magicians, lions, bears, and a massive elephant populate the stage. The central mystery captivates young audiences: why does such a powerful elephant remain bound to a tiny wooden stake? This seemingly simple question opens a profound exploration of how childhood fears and limitations shape our sense of possibility. The story addresses how we can overcome inherited anxieties and discover hidden strengths through self-knowledge, self-confidence, and belief in our capabilities.

The second tale transports audiences to a distant kingdom where a king discovers that our most terrible enemy can become our greatest friend once we truly understand them. This narrative examines fundamental life values including love, hate, humility, vanity, self-esteem, and courage, presenting complex emotional concepts through accessible theatrical storytelling.

Dimitris Plionis leads an exceptional creative team bringing these stories to the Cretan stage. Composer Nasos Sopylis created original music that enhances the emotional journey, while Myrto Kosmopoulou designed both sets and costumes. The five-member ensemble—Maria Sareli, Vasilina Katerini, Konstantinos Dimitrakakis, Thomas Tsaknakis, and Plionis himself—employs humor, interaction, and imagination to engage children throughout the 10-euro performance.

Jorge Bucay, born in Buenos Aires in 1949, practiced as a Gestalt psychotherapist before becoming an internationally celebrated author. His books have been translated into over twenty languages and topped bestseller lists worldwide. Greek audiences particularly embrace his accessible wisdom, with Opera publications releasing multiple titles including "Let Me Tell You a Story" and "Stories to Think About."

The production's success in Athens demonstrates its resonance with Greek families seeking meaningful cultural experiences. Movement and choreography by Agni Papadeli Rossettou, lighting by Stefanos Kopanakis, and collaborative songwriting by Stratos Sopylis, Dimitris Plionis, and Marina Panigyrakis create a cohesive theatrical experience. This Heraklion presentation offers Cretan families an opportunity to experience a production that celebrates imagination, emotional growth, and the transformative power of storytelling for audiences of all ages.
