November has always held special significance for Σπυριδούλα, one of Greece's most important rock bands. Founded in September 1977 by brothers Vasilis and Nikos Spyropoulos, the band revolutionized the Greek rock scene and became legendary through their collaboration with Pavlos Sidiropoulos on the iconic album ΦΛΟΥ (Flou). This Saturday, November 8th at Kyttaro Live, they're celebrating the month that shaped their history: their first concert on November 6th, Nikos' birthday on November 7th, and their first meeting with Pavlos on November 20th.

This isn't just another concert—it's a three-hour electric celebration honoring those who built Greek rock and those no longer with us. The event pays tribute to the memory of Pavlos Sidiropoulos, Nikos Spyropoulos, and Tolis Mastrokalos, the founding members whose vision created one of the most influential sounds in Greek music history. Through 48 years, hundreds of performances, and five albums, Σπυριδούλα has remained a cornerstone of authentic Greek rock.

After Nikos Spyropoulos' passing, the band fell silent until last year, when the surviving members decided to commemorate the 45th anniversary of ΦΛΟΥ with a special tribute. That album, born from the collaboration with Pavlos Sidiropoulos, is widely considered emblematic of Greek rock's golden era. Now, the remaining members continue this tribute, presenting their journey from those early days at Kyttaro's welcoming stage.

The evening features an exceptional lineup of guest artists who represent the depth of Greece's rock lineage. Alexis Kalofolias, known for his work with Last Drive and Holly Stranger, brings his distinctive guitar sound. Grigoris Klioumis from Υπόγεια Ρεύματα (Underground Currents) adds his powerful presence. Frank Panx, the force behind Panx Romana and Σαλταδόροι, contributes his raw energy. Giorgos Pavlidis, from Χάσμα (Chasma) and Πεθαίνουν στο τέλος (They Die at the End), completes this gathering of Greek rock royalty.

Kyttaro Live, located at 48 Ipeirou Street near Acharnon in central Athens, has been the heartbeat of the city's alternative music scene for decades. This venue has witnessed countless legendary performances, making it the perfect setting for Σπυριδούλα's November celebration. The 12€ entrance fee (advance tickets available at more.com) offers access to a night where Greek rock history comes alive through the hands of those who created it and those who carry its spirit forward. Doors open at 21:00 for an evening that promises to remind everyone where Greek rock began and honor those who made it possible.
