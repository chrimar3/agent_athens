On November 9th, 2025, at noon, Stavros tou Notou Plus transforms into a space where Greek children's music receives the live concert treatment it deserves. "ëù ëöü•£ïô£ §ë †ëôîôë" (If You Listen to the Children) brings together Lefteris Eleftherioua multi-talented actor and performerand Alkiviadis Konstantopoulosa beloved singer-songwriter known as a "one-man orchestra"for a musical celebration that treats young audiences with the respect serious music demands while delivering the joy children's entertainment requires.

Following a series of sold-out performances, this extended run demonstrates that Athens families hunger for live music experiences that don't condescend to children or reduce artistry to background noise. The production's premise is simple but revolutionary in execution: What if children's concerts received the same production valueslive musicians, professional lighting, quality sound designtypically reserved for adult performances? This question challenges the assumption that children's entertainment must be cheaply produced or artistically compromised.

The setlist spans generations of Greek children's music, from contemporary works like "Lilipoupoli" (Lilliput City), "Ta Mystika tou Kipou" (Garden Secrets), and "O Tempelis Drakos" (The Lazy Dragon) to classic melodies parents remember from their own childhoods and songs children know from school or beloved animated films. This intergenerational approach matters: shared musical experiences create family memories while introducing children to material that has survived precisely because of its artistic quality rather than marketing budgets.

Lefteris Eleftheriou and Alkiviadis Konstantopoulos bring complementary skills to this collaboration. Eleftheriou's theatrical background ensures the performance incorporates interactive and dramatic elements that maintain children's attention without relying on screens or digital distractions. Konstantopoulos's musical versatility allows live arrangements that adapt in real-time to audience energy. Joining them onstage is Odysseas Konstantopoulos, described as "maestro," providing additional musical depth and demonstrating to children what live ensemble performance looks and sounds like.

The noon timingunusual for concerts but perfectly calibrated for children's schedulespositions this as daytime family programming that respects young people's attention spans and energy patterns. Weekend mornings when children are alert and receptive, before afternoon fatigue sets in, before the overstimulation of birthday parties or mall excursions. This scheduling demonstrates understanding of actual children rather than abstract ideas about childhood.

Stavros tou Notou Plus has established itself as Athens' venue for music programming that refuses false choices between artistic ambition and popular accessibility. Their commitment to hosting children's concerts with production values equal to adult performances signals respect for young audiences as legitimate participants in Athens' cultural life rather than future consumers who must wait until adulthood to experience real music.

The production's emphasis on "listening to children"both the title and conceptual frameworkcarries pedagogical weight. In a media environment saturated with visual stimulation, live music without screens teaches focused listening, demonstrates that entertainment doesn't require constant visual novelty, and models attention as practice rather than passive consumption. For Athens families seeking alternatives to screen-based entertainment, "ëù ëöü•£ïô£ §ë †ëôîôë" offers validation that children can and will engage with live performance when it's executed with genuine artistic commitment and understanding of young audiences as worthy of respect.
