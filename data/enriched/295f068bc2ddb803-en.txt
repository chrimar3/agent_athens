On an Athens evening that bridges continents and generations, Kassandra Charalampi returns to Half Note Jazz Club with her internationally acclaimed ensemble, featuring Greek jazz legend Takis Paterelis on tenor saxophone. This homecoming performance marks a full-circle journey for the young vocalist whose musical odyssey began at age four, studying piano with her father in Athens.

Charalampi's path to becoming one of Greece's most promising jazz exports took her first to Spain's prestigious Musikene (Basque Country's Higher Music School), where she graduated in 2017 after five transformative years. Under the mentorship of jazz luminaries Judy Niemack, Deborah Carter, Bob Sands, and Guillermo McGill, she carved out her distinctive voice on the Iberian Peninsula's vibrant jazz circuit. Her Spanish chapter included commanding performances at Heineken Jazzaldia San Sebastián, Bogui Jazz Madrid, and Jimmy Glass Valencia, plus memorable collaborations with soul icons Kim Weston, Dee Dee Sharp, and Mitch Ryder.

The vocalist's 2018 move to New York City elevated her artistry further. Earning her Master's degree from Aaron Copland School of Music at Queens College in 2020, Charalampi immersed herself in Manhattan's legendary jazz ecosystem. She has since graced the stages of Minton's Playhouse, Zinc Bar, Mezzrow, and The Django, sharing bandstands with luminaries including Johnny O'Neal, Emmet Cohen, Saul Rubin, and Michael Kanan.

Tonight's program showcases Charalampi's signature versatility: dynamic swing standards, sensual boleros, and subversive reimaginings of Beatles and Sam Cooke classics. Her voice carries Greek soul, Mediterranean fire, and New York authenticity in equal measure.

Joining her is the exceptional Konstantinos Stouraitis trio, veterans of stages from Athens' Onassis Stegi to Barcelona's Jamboree Jazz Club to West Village venues. Guitarist Stouraitis and double bassist Kimonas Karoutzos were Charalampi's classmates during their New York studies at Queens College and Manhattan School of Music respectively. Drummer Panagiotis Themas completes the rhythm section with impeccable precision.

The evening's crowning element is Takis Paterelis on tenor saxophone, described aptly as "an integral part of Greek jazz history." His presence transforms this concert into an intergenerational dialogue, connecting Athens' jazz legacy with its global future.

Half Note Jazz Club, Athens' premiere jazz venue, provides the perfect setting for this musical summit where Greek tradition meets international sophistication, and a daughter of Athens returns with stories told through song.
