At the Maria Callas Museum, opera transforms into play and play becomes expression, collaboration, and creation through an innovative educational workshop designed for families. This experiential music-pedagogical journey into the magical world of opera and sound invites children and their companions to explore three iconic operas—Norma, Tosca, and Traviata—through the inspiration of the great diva's voice and personality. The program emphasizes that no previous musical knowledge is required, opening opera's traditionally exclusive world to all families willing to engage with curiosity and openness.

Ultimately, "Opera Becomes Play" demonstrates how cultural institutions can make their holdings accessible and meaningful to new generations. Rather than preserving Callas's legacy through static museum displays alone, the workshop activates that legacy through living engagement, showing how great artists inspire not through veneration but through creative participation in the artistic domains they inhabited. For children experiencing the workshop, opera transforms from distant cultural phenomenon to immediate creative possibility.
