The Half Note Jazz Club in Mets welcomes an extraordinary convergence of jazz mastery this November, as Andy James and Jon Cowherd bring their All Stars ensemble to Athens for a four-night residency from November 14-17. This isn't just another jazz concert—it's a gathering of legendary musicians whose combined careers span decades of innovation and genre-defining performances.

At the heart of this collaboration stands Alex Acuña, the Peruvian percussion virtuoso whose rhythmic vocabulary has shaped modern jazz and Latin fusion. With a discography that includes work with Weather Report, Chick Corea, and Joni Mitchell, Acuña brings a lifetime of groove mastery to the Half Note stage. His ability to seamlessly blend Afro-Cuban rhythms with contemporary jazz sensibilities has made him one of the most sought-after drummers in the world.

Joining him is Dominique Di Piazza, the French bassist whose pioneering work in solo electric bass has redefined the instrument's possibilities. Known for his tenure with John McLaughlin's trio and his innovative approach to bass harmonics and extended techniques, Di Piazza transforms the bass guitar into a lead voice, creating melodic landscapes that defy conventional expectations. His presence guarantees an evening where the rhythm section doesn't just support—it leads.

Rounding out this powerhouse lineup is Canito, adding another layer of percussive brilliance to an already formidable ensemble. The combination of these three rhythm masters with Andy James and Jon Cowherd creates a musical conversation that explores the full spectrum of contemporary jazz—from hard-swinging bebop to exploratory fusion territories.

The Half Note Jazz Club, nestled in the culturally rich Mets neighborhood near the Panathenaic Stadium, provides the perfect intimate setting for this musical summit. With a capacity of 200, the venue's legendary acoustics and sophisticated atmosphere have made it Athens' premier destination for world-class jazz since its opening. The club's reputation for hosting international jazz royalty while maintaining an approachable, music-first environment makes it the ideal home for this ambitious collaboration.

The late 22:30 start time honors jazz tradition, allowing the music to unfold without constraint into the Athens night. The four-night residency format means each evening will develop its own character as these musicians explore different facets of their shared musical language. For jazz enthusiasts in Athens, this represents a rare opportunity to witness living legends in an intimate club setting—the kind of experience that defines what makes Half Note an essential cultural institution in the Greek capital's thriving music scene.
