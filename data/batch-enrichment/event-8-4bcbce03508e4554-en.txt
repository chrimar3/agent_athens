Following her triumphant sold-out performances at the iconic Pallas Theatre in Athens and Theatre Kipou in Thessaloniki, Sophia Manousaki returns to the stage for her highly anticipated winter concert series. On November 7th at 21:30, the acclaimed Greek artist takes over Gazarte's Roof Stage in the heart of Gazi, bringing together an ensemble of exceptional musicians for an intimate evening that promises to captivate audiences with her distinctive musical voice.

Sophia Manousaki has established herself as one of contemporary Greece's most compelling performers, with her recent theatrical performances demonstrating her ability to connect deeply with audiences. The sold-out shows at Pallas Theatre and Thessaloniki's Theatre Kipou weren't just concerts—they were cultural moments that showcased her evolution as an artist. Now, as winter approaches, she transitions from grand theatre halls to the more intimate setting of Gazarte's rooftop, creating an opportunity for audiences to experience her artistry in a uniquely atmospheric environment.

The Gazarte Roof Stage provides the perfect backdrop for this winter series. This 200-capacity venue sits atop one of Athens' most beloved cultural complexes at Pireos 100, offering sweeping views of the city skyline that transform as evening descends over the Gazi neighborhood. The rooftop setting creates an almost cinematic experience, where Manousaki's music floats above the vibrant streets below, merging with the urban energy of one of Athens' most dynamic districts.

Gazi and Keramikos have long been at the forefront of Athens' cultural renaissance. Once an industrial area dominated by the historic gasworks, this neighborhood has evolved into the city's creative heart, where converted warehouses host galleries, music venues, and performance spaces. Gazarte itself exemplifies this transformation, occupying multiple levels of a restored industrial building and offering everything from intimate concerts to art exhibitions. The venue's proximity to Kerameikos metro station makes it easily accessible, while its position in the neighborhood's cultural corridor means concertgoers can extend their evening exploring nearby bars, restaurants, and venues.

For this winter series, Manousaki has assembled a band of excellent musicians whose collective talent promises to elevate her already impressive performances. The collaboration suggests an evening of carefully crafted arrangements and spontaneous musical conversations, the kind of experience that makes live performance irreplaceable. At Gazarte Roof Stage on November 7th, audiences will witness not just a concert, but the continuation of Sophia Manousaki's remarkable artistic journey.
