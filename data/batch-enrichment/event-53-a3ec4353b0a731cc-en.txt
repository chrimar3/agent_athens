On Sunday, November 23, 2025, the Glass Musical Theater in Nea Smyrni welcomes Vivilena for a captivating evening titled "From Old to New" (Apo Ta Palia Sta Kainouria). Starting at 21:00, this concert promises to take audiences on a musical journey that bridges generations, exploring the evolution of Greek music through carefully curated repertoire that honors tradition while embracing contemporary expression.

Vivilena has established herself as an artist who respects the roots of Greek musical heritage while fearlessly exploring new artistic territories. This particular show embodies that philosophy perfectly. The title "From Old to New" suggests a performance that will trace musical lineages, perhaps beginning with classic rebetiko or traditional folk melodies before transitioning into modern interpretations and contemporary compositions. It's an approach that allows audiences to experience the continuity of Greek musical culture, understanding how yesterday's innovations inform today's creative expressions.

The Glass Musical Theater (Gyalino Mousiko Theatro) provides an intimate yet professional setting for this performance. Located on Syngrou Avenue in the Nea Smyrni district, this 400-capacity venue has been a cornerstone of Athens' cultural landscape since 1997. For nearly three decades, it has hosted countless memorable evenings of music, theater, and performance art, building a reputation for quality programming and excellent acoustics. The venue's name reflects its architectural character, featuring glass elements that create an open, welcoming atmosphere while maintaining the intimacy essential for musical performances where every note and nuance matters.

Nea Smyrni itself offers a compelling backdrop for an evening out. This southern Athens neighborhood combines residential charm with cultural vitality, and it's easily accessible via the Agios Ioannis metro station on Line 2, making the venue convenient for residents across the metropolitan area. The neighborhood's tree-lined streets and neighborhood cafes provide pleasant options for pre-concert dinner or post-show conversation.

Sunday evening concerts hold special appeal in Athens, offering a perfect way to close the weekend with artistic enrichment. The 21:00 start time allows audiences to enjoy a leisurely dinner before settling into their seats for what promises to be a musically diverse and emotionally resonant performance. With Vivilena's artistic vision guiding the journey from old to new, attendees can expect an evening that celebrates Greek musical heritage while demonstrating its ongoing vitality and relevance in contemporary culture.
