On November 6th at 20:00, TV Control Center in Kypseli hosts an evening of experimental sound featuring two distinctive acts from opposite sides of the Atlantic. The Budokan Boys, a duo from the USA, arrive in Athens to present their new album "THE OOZE," with French percussionist Eiger Drums Propaganda opening the night with a solo drum set performance.

TV Control Center, known locally as KET, occupies a former television repair shop from the 1970s at the intersection of Kyprou 91A and Sikinou 35A. Since 2012, this intimate 80-capacity space has served as a gathering point for Athens' experimental arts community, hosting performing arts, documentary screenings, and music that pushes beyond conventional boundaries. The venue sits near Agios Nikolaos metro station, making it accessible while retaining the residential character that defines Kypseli's creative underground.

The Budokan Boys bring "THE OOZE" to this compact setting, where the proximity between performers and audience creates a different listening experience than larger venues allow. Working as a duo, they've crafted an album that benefits from the kind of focused attention a room of 80 people can provide. The intimacy of KET means every textural detail, every dynamic shift registers with clarity.

Opening the evening, Eiger Drums Propaganda presents a solo drum set performance. Working alone with percussion, the French artist explores rhythm as both structure and material, treating the drum kit as a complete instrument rather than a backing element. Solo percussion work demands a particular kind of attention from listeners—without melody or harmony to guide the ear, the focus shifts to pattern, texture, and the physical properties of sound itself.

This pairing reflects KET's programming philosophy: bringing together artists who share an experimental approach while working in distinct sonic territories. The venue has maintained this focus for over a decade, creating a space where Athens residents interested in alternative music know they can encounter work that doesn't fit easily into commercial categories.

The 80-person capacity means tickets for events like this typically move quickly within Athens' experimental music community. The former TV repair shop setting, with its history of technical equipment and electronic signals, provides an appropriate backdrop for artists working at the edges of contemporary sound. From Agios Nikolaos metro, it's a short walk into Kypseli's residential streets to reach this corner space where the neighborhood's creative community has established a consistent venue for challenging work. The November 6th concert starts at 20:00, offering a full evening of percussion and experimental sound in one of Athens' most distinctive small venues.
