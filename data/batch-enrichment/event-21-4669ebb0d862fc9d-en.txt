Three Times Three #2 brings experimental artistry to Kypseli's cultural heart on November 10th at 21:00, continuing the monthly series that dissolves boundaries between contemporary dance and experimental music. This second edition transforms TV Control Center (KET) into an intimate laboratory where movement and sound engage in unpredictable dialogue.

The Three Times Three series has quickly established itself as Athens' essential monthly gathering for artists exploring the intersection of choreographic thinking and sonic experimentation. Each edition presents carefully curated performances that challenge conventional distinctions between dance and music, creating hybrid experiences where bodies become instruments and sound becomes spatial. The format encourages risk-taking and improvisation, qualities that define KET's programming philosophy since the venue opened its doors in 2012.

TV Control Center occupies a converted 1970s television repair shop in Kypseli, maintaining the neighborhood's tradition of repurposing industrial spaces into creative venues. The 80-capacity room creates an immediacy between performers and audience that larger venues cannot achieve. Former workbenches and repair equipment remnants add textural character to the space, reminding visitors of the building's utilitarian past while serving present-day artistic exploration. This intimate scale allows audiences to perceive subtle gestural details and ambient sonic textures that would disappear in conventional theaters.

Kypseli itself has evolved into one of Athens' most vibrant creative neighborhoods, attracting artists, musicians, and independent cultural initiatives. The area's diverse community and accessible rent structures have fostered experimental venues like KET alongside rehearsal studios, artist collectives, and alternative performance spaces. Walking to the venue from Agios Nikolaos metro station reveals Kypseli's character through street art, independent cafes, and the architectural mix of early 20th-century apartment buildings.

The monthly rhythm of Three Times Three allows the series to build a dedicated community of regular attendees while remaining open to newcomers curious about experimental performance. Each edition features different artists, ensuring variety while maintaining conceptual coherence around the dance-music intersection. The 21:00 start time accommodates Athens' nocturnal cultural patterns, allowing audiences to experience the performance and continue their evening in Kypseli's surrounding bars and gathering spots.

This second edition promises to expand the possibilities established in the series' inaugural event, presenting artists who treat the 80-capacity room as both stage and instrument. The performance's experimental nature means audience members become witnesses to genuine creative investigation rather than polished spectacle, an approach that distinguishes KET's programming within Athens' performing arts landscape.
