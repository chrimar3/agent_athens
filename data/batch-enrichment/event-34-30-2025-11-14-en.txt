Dimitris Mitsotakis marks three decades of rock music mastery with an intimate celebration at Caja De Musica in Ampelokipoi on November 14, 2025. This milestone concert, beginning at 22:00, brings together fans and music lovers in one of Athens' most acoustically refined venues to honor a career that has shaped Greek rock across generations.

For thirty years, Mitsotakis has been a driving force in Athens' rock scene, most notably through his work with Endeleheia, the band that became synonymous with authentic Greek rock expression. His musical journey spans an era of transformation in Greek alternative music, from underground clubs to established venues, maintaining an uncompromising artistic vision throughout. This anniversary concert promises a retrospective journey through defining moments, rare performances, and the evolution of a sound that resonated with audiences seeking genuine rock authenticity.

Caja De Musica provides the perfect setting for this celebration. Located at Sinopis 27 and Michalakopoulou in the Ampelokipoi-Gkyzi neighborhood, the venue's reputation for exceptional acoustics makes every note resonate with clarity. With capacity for 200 attendees—150 seated and 50 standing—the space creates an intimate connection between performer and audience that larger venues cannot replicate. This proximity allows fans to experience the raw energy and technical precision that define Mitsotakis' live performances.

The venue's wheelchair accessibility ensures inclusivity, while its location near Ambelokipi metro station (a ten-minute walk) makes attendance convenient for music lovers across Athens. The Ampelokipoi-Gkyzi neighborhood itself contributes to the evening's atmosphere, a residential area that has quietly supported Athens' cultural life through venues like Caja De Musica that prioritize artistic quality over commercial trends.

What makes this concert particularly significant is its timing—thirty years represents not just longevity but sustained relevance in a music landscape constantly shifting. Mitsotakis and Endeleheia navigated changing tastes without compromising their rock foundation, building a catalog that speaks to multiple generations. Expect a setlist that honors this legacy, drawing from career-defining albums while potentially offering glimpses into future directions.
