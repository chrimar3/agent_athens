On November 22, 2025, ARCH in Tavros transforms into a cross-cultural sonic laboratory where Spanish experimental sounds collide with Greece's underground electronic scene. This four-act lineup represents the kind of programming that has made ARCH one of Athens' most vital alternative music venues, consistently bridging Mediterranean musical traditions with contemporary avant-garde expression.

LAS NINYAS DEL CORRO arrive from Spain carrying a reputation for deconstructing traditional Iberian sounds through a distinctly modern lens. Their approach merges folkloric elements with experimental electronic production, creating performances that honor cultural roots while aggressively pushing into uncharted territory. The duo's live shows have earned recognition across Europe's underground circuit for their intensity and unpredictability, making their Athens appearance a significant cultural exchange moment.

0-100 ΣΕΙΡΕΝΕ (Sirens) bring Athens' own experimental edge to the lineup. The Greek project explores the intersection of mythology and modernity, weaving ancient narrative structures into contemporary sound design. Their name references the mythological sirens, but their sonic approach is resolutely forward-facing, utilizing electronic textures and unconventional rhythmic structures to create immersive atmospheric experiences that challenge traditional concert formats.

SCI-FI RIVER adds another dimension to the evening's sonic palette, drawing from science fiction aesthetics and ambient electronic traditions. Their set promises to explore the spacious, meditative territories of electronic music, providing contrast to the more aggressive elements of the lineup while maintaining the evening's experimental thread.

DJ PITSOUNI anchors the night with selections that contextualize the live performances within broader underground music movements. Greek DJ culture has its own distinct flavor, and PITSOUNI's ability to navigate between genres and moods will provide essential connective tissue between the evening's diverse acts.

ARCH's location in Tavros, just southwest of central Athens, has become synonymous with the city's alternative music scene. The 700-capacity venue offers an industrial-tinged atmosphere that complements experimental programming perfectly. The neighborhood itself has emerged as a creative hub, with ARCH serving as a cultural anchor for Athens' underground communities seeking spaces that prioritize artistic risk-taking over commercial considerations.

This multi-act evening represents the kind of curatorial vision that keeps Athens connected to broader European underground networks while showcasing local experimental talent. The combination of Spanish and Greek acts creates dialogue between Mediterranean countries' contemporary music scenes, revealing shared interests in deconstructing tradition and exploring electronic music's expanding possibilities. For those tracking Athens' alternative music movements, this lineup offers a concentrated snapshot of current underground aesthetics.
