In the shadow of ancient Athens, where myth and memory intertwine, BIOS presents ΛΗΘΗ (Lethe), a theatrical exploration of forgetting that runs from November 11, 2025, through January 27, 2026. Named after the river in Greek mythology whose waters granted souls oblivion before rebirth, this extended production promises to examine the paradox of memory: what we choose to remember, what we're forced to forget, and what forgetting truly means in our contemporary moment.

The mythological Lethe flowed through Hades, offering the dead a drink that would erase all memories of their earthly existence before reincarnation. This theatrical interpretation takes that ancient concept and filters it through the lens of modern Athens, where layers of history—classical, Byzantine, Ottoman, modern—create a palimpsest of collective memory. The extended run through late January suggests an ambitious, evolving work that may transform throughout its 11-week engagement, inviting audiences to return and experience how the production itself remembers and forgets.

BIOS, situated at Pireos 84 in the culturally dynamic Keramikos-Gazi district, provides the perfect venue for such mythologically-rooted contemporary work. This 500-capacity space has established itself as Athens' premier destination for innovative, boundary-pushing performances that honor Greek cultural heritage while interrogating it through modern perspectives. The venue's industrial architecture—a converted factory that remembers its own past even as it hosts performances about forgetting—creates a meta-theatrical environment where form and content resonate.

The Keramikos-Gazi neighborhood itself embodies themes of memory and transformation. Once Athens' ancient cemetery (Keramikos), then an industrial zone, now a thriving cultural quarter, the area physically manifests the cycles of remembering and forgetting that Lethe explores. Adjacent to the ancient city walls and minutes from Technopolis, the former gasworks turned cultural center, the district pulses with creative energy every evening.

Each performance begins at 20:00, allowing audiences to experience the production as darkness falls—appropriate for a work named after an underworld river. The convenient Kerameikos metro station provides direct access, making this extended theatrical journey accessible throughout the winter months. Whether you attend in November's autumn chill or January's midwinter darkness, ΛΗΘΗ offers an opportunity to confront fundamental questions: In a city where every stone holds memory, what happens when we drink from the waters of forgetting? What remains when memory dissolves? And can theater itself become a river that carries us between remembering and oblivion?
