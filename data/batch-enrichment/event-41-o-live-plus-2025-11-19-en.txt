On November 19, 2025, Kostis takes the stage at Stavros tou Notou Plus in the heart of Neos Kosmos, delivering an intimate live performance that promises to showcase the raw energy and emotional depth that has defined his musical journey. This concert marks another chapter in the storied legacy of one of Athens' most beloved music venues, a space that has been nurturing Greek musical talent since 1995.

Stavros tou Notou Plus, the 300-capacity sister stage to the iconic Stavros tou Notou complex, offers an intimate setting perfect for experiencing Kostis's powerful vocals and authentic stage presence. Located at Tharipou 37 & Frantzi in Neos Kosmos, this venue has become synonymous with quality live music in Athens, attracting both established artists and devoted music lovers who appreciate performances in a space where every seat feels close to the action.

The evening begins at 21:00, following the Mediterranean tradition of late-night cultural gatherings that allow audiences to unwind from their day and fully immerse themselves in the musical experience. Kostis's performance style demands this kind of unhurried attention, as he weaves together melodies and lyrics that speak to contemporary Greek life while honoring the deep roots of Greek musical tradition.

Neos Kosmos, the neighborhood surrounding Stavros tou Notou Plus, has evolved into one of Athens' most dynamic cultural districts. Once a primarily residential area, it now pulses with artistic energy, drawing crowds who come for the authentic musical experiences that larger, more commercial venues cannot provide. The metro accessibility via Syngrou-Fix station makes reaching the venue straightforward for both Athenians and visitors, eliminating the typical urban navigation stress and allowing concertgoers to focus entirely on the evening ahead.

For three decades, the Stavros tou Notou complex has been a cornerstone of Greek music culture, providing a platform where artists can connect with audiences in meaningful ways. The Plus stage continues this tradition, maintaining the intimate atmosphere that makes live music transcendent rather than merely entertaining. When Kostis performs here, he joins a lineage of Greek musicians who have used this space to create memorable nights that resonate long after the final notes fade.

This November evening offers music enthusiasts an opportunity to experience contemporary Greek music in a venue that understands its cultural responsibility, delivered by an artist who respects both his craft and his audience.
