Rock and metal collide at Caja De Musica on November 21st when AC/DC Tribute Gang teams up with Fotis Romanidis Gang for an electrifying double bill that promises to shake the foundations of this intimate Ampelokipoi venue. Starting at 22:00, this concert brings together two powerhouse acts that represent different eras and styles of hard rock, creating an evening that celebrates the genre's enduring spirit.

AC/DC Tribute Gang has built a formidable reputation across Athens for their faithful recreation of the Australian rock titans' legendary sound. From the thunderous opening chords of "Back in Black" to the stadium-sized energy of "Highway to Hell," this tribute band captures the raw power and swagger that made AC/DC one of the most influential rock bands in history. Their commitment to authentic sound, right down to the Angus Young-style guitar solos and Brian Johnson's distinctive vocals, transforms the tribute format into a genuine celebration of rock's golden era.

Complementing this tribute power is Fotis Romanidis Gang, a force in Athens' contemporary rock and metal scene. Romanidis and his band bring original material that channels the aggressive energy and technical prowess of modern metal while maintaining the melodic accessibility that makes great rock music timeless. The Gang's live performances are known for their intensity and musicianship, creating a perfect counterpoint to the AC/DC tribute's classic rock foundation.

Caja De Musica provides the ideal setting for this double bill. Located at Sinopis 27 & Michalakopoulou in the Ampelokipoi-Gkyzi neighborhood, this 200-capacity venue (150 seated, 50 standing) has earned its reputation for exceptional acoustics that allow rock music to breathe properly. The intimate space means every guitar riff, drum fill, and vocal line reaches the audience with clarity and power, creating the kind of visceral experience that larger venues often sacrifice. The venue's wheelchair accessibility ensures that rock music remains inclusive, while the neighborhood's proximity to Ambelokipi Metro station (10 minutes walk) makes arrival effortless.

Ampelokipoi-Gkyzi represents Athens' musical heart, where historic venues and contemporary spaces coexist. The neighborhood's tree-lined streets and local tavernas provide pre-concert gathering spots, while the area's diverse music scene ensures that audiences here appreciate authentic performances over manufactured spectacle.

This double bill offers rock and metal fans a rare opportunity to experience both tribute excellence and original Greek metal in one evening. Whether you're reliving AC/DC's greatest moments or discovering Fotis Romanidis Gang's powerful sound, this concert promises an unforgettable night of thunderous guitars, pounding rhythms, and the raw energy that defines rock music at its finest.
