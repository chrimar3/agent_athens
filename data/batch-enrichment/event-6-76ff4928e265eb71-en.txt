Sound Dreams of Istanbul: A Documentary Journey Through Experimental Music

On November 7, 2025, at 21:00, the intimate TV Control Center in Kypseli transforms into a bridge between Athens and Istanbul's experimental music scenes. Musician and director Anıl Eraslan presents "Sound Dreams of Istanbul," a 70-minute documentary that captures the vibrant community of experimental and improvisational musicians thriving in Turkey's cultural capital. The evening concludes with a live set by Eraslan alongside collaborator Merve Salgar, creating a hybrid experience that blends cinematic storytelling with spontaneous musical expression.

The documentary offers an insider's perspective into Istanbul's underground music scene, a network of artists pushing boundaries through sonic experimentation and collective improvisation. Through intimate footage and candid conversations, Eraslan reveals how this creative community navigates the intersection of tradition and innovation, creating soundscapes that challenge conventional musical structures. The film captures rehearsal spaces, impromptu performances, and the collaborative spirit that defines this movement, presenting a portrait of artistic resilience in a city where East meets West.

Following the screening, Eraslan and Salgar will perform a live set that embodies the documentary's themes. Their performance promises to demonstrate the improvisational techniques and experimental approaches featured in the film, offering audiences an immediate connection to Istanbul's sonic innovation. This format allows viewers to transition from observation to immersion, experiencing firsthand the creative processes explored on screen.

The venue itself reflects Athens' own experimental arts spirit. TV Control Center, known locally as KET, occupies a converted 1970s television repair shop in Kypseli. Since 2012, this 80-capacity space has championed performing arts, experimental music, documentary screenings, and cultural seminars. The intimate setting creates an environment where audiences and artists share the same space, fostering dialogue and discovery. Located near Agios Nikolaos metro station, KET sits in Kypseli, a neighborhood experiencing cultural renaissance through grassroots arts initiatives and community-driven creativity.

This evening offers more than entertainment; it presents a cultural exchange between two cities united by their commitment to experimental arts. For those interested in contemporary music that defies categorization, documentary filmmaking that captures underground movements, or simply discovering new sonic territories, this event provides rare access to Istanbul's experimental music world. The combination of documentary screening and live performance creates a complete experience, connecting Athens audiences with a creative community that shares their passion for artistic exploration and innovation.
