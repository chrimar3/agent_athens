On November 27th, 2025, the TV Control Center in Athens' Kypseli neighborhood hosts an extraordinary collision of early cinema history and contemporary live performance. Semeli-Sofia Kostourou and Max Reubel present a live soundtrack to "L'Inferno" (1911), the pioneering Italian silent film that first brought Dante Alighieri's medieval masterwork to the screen.

Francesco Bertolini's "L'Inferno" remains a landmark achievement in cinema history—the first feature-length Italian film and one of the earliest full adaptations of classic literature. Released in 1911, this 70-minute odyssey through hell predated Hollywood's epic ambitions by years, employing groundbreaking special effects, elaborate sets, and hundreds of actors to visualize Dante's circles of damnation. The film's hand-tinted scenes and innovative double-exposure techniques created imagery that shocked and captivated Edwardian audiences, proving that cinema could tackle sophisticated literary subjects with artistic integrity.

Live soundtrack performances transform silent films from museum pieces into breathing contemporary experiences. When Kostourou and Reubel improvise their musical response to Bertolini's imagery, they're continuing a tradition as old as cinema itself—before synchronized sound, every screening was a live collaboration between image and musician. This particular pairing promises something special: two artists responding in real-time to a film that's equal parts religious art, Gothic horror, and technical innovation.

The TV Control Center provides the ideal setting for this experimental encounter. Located in Kypseli, one of Athens' most characterful neighborhoods, the venue's 80-person capacity ensures an intimate experience where every audience member shares equally in the performance's immediacy. The space, known for championing boundary-pushing work across disciplines, understands that live cinema requires focused attention—this isn't background entertainment but a demanding, rewarding journey through one artist's interpretation of Dante's medieval hell, filtered through another era's cinematic language, now given new life through contemporary sound.

Kypseli itself mirrors this layering of eras. Once Athens' most cosmopolitan district, now undergoing cultural renaissance, the neighborhood embodies the same spirit of transformation that defines live soundtrack work—honoring history while making it urgently contemporary. The event starts at 21:00, giving audiences time to navigate to this residential area north of the city center. With limited capacity, advance planning is essential for anyone wanting to experience how two 21st-century performers dialogue with a 114-year-old vision of eternal punishment—a conversation across centuries that promises to be anything but antiquarian.
