WALKMAN THE BAND brings their distinctive fusion of music and comedy to Glass Musical Theater on November 8, 2025, at 22:00, promising an evening that defies traditional performance categories. Led by Vasilis Fusteris and Agapi Mokatourova, this show represents a bold experiment in contemporary entertainment, where musical excellence meets comedic timing in unexpected ways.

Glass Musical Theater, situated on Syngrou Avenue in Nea Smyrni, has been a cornerstone of Athens' cultural landscape since 1997. This 400-capacity venue has witnessed countless performances over its nearly three-decade history, but WALKMAN THE BAND's approach to live entertainment feels particularly suited to its intimate atmosphere. The theater's reputation for hosting innovative acts makes it the perfect setting for a performance that refuses to be confined to a single genre.

Vasilis Fusteris and Agapi Mokatourova have crafted something unique with WALKMAN THE BAND. Their show seamlessly integrates stand-up comedy elements with live musical performance, creating moments where a guitar riff can transition into a punchline, or where a comedic observation naturally evolves into a song. This format challenges audiences to abandon their expectations about what a concert or comedy show should be, instead embracing a hybrid form that capitalizes on the strengths of both disciplines.

The Nea Smyrni location offers practical advantages for attendees. The Agios Ioannis metro station provides direct access to the venue, making it easily reachable from across Athens without the complications of parking in the city center. The neighborhood itself has evolved into a cultural hub, with numerous cafes and restaurants surrounding the theater, allowing audiences to extend their evening beyond the performance itself.

Starting at 22:00, the show timing reflects Athens' nightlife culture, where the evening truly begins after dark. The late start time also means the performance can unfold without rushing, giving Fusteris and Mokatourova the space to develop their material organically, responding to audience energy and allowing improvised moments to emerge naturally.

For those seeking entertainment that challenges conventional formats, WALKMAN THE BAND offers an experience that is simultaneously familiar and refreshingly different. The combination of musical talent and comedic sensibility, performed in the historically significant space of Glass Musical Theater, creates an evening that speaks to Athens' ongoing evolution as a city where artistic experimentation finds both venue and audience. The show represents the kind of cultural cross-pollination that defines contemporary Athens performance culture.
