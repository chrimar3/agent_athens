Stavros tou Notou Club, located in the heart of Athens, has earned its reputation as a sanctuary for discerning music lovers who appreciate quality over spectacle.

The November residency format offers concert-goers multiple opportunities to experience Bakoulis' artistry across different evenings, with each performance potentially offering unique interpretations and setlist variations.

It offers an authentic glimpse into the city's vibrant cultural life, where locals and travelers gather to celebrate Greece's living musical traditions. The venue's neighborhood location invites exploration of surrounding cafés, tavernas, and cultural spaces that define contemporary Athenian life.

Tickets are required for this ticketed event, and given the venue's intimate capacity and Bakoulis' popularity, advance booking is strongly recommended. The 8:00 PM start time allows attendees to enjoy an early dinner in the neighborhood before the performance, making it easy to craft a complete evening of Athenian cultural immersion.
